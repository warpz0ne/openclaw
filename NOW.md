## Current Objective
Set up durable session continuity so context survives overnight and across restarts.

## Current Focus
Rebuild continuity workflow before resuming feature/project work.

## Next 3 Actions
1. Keep `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` updated after each meaningful work block.
2. Update `MEMORY.md` when decisions/preferences become long-term.
3. End each session with a handoff snapshot (Done / In progress / Next step).

## Open Thread to Resume
Slice login UX is mid-migration to custom OAuth button flow (to eliminate Google iframe white strip + remembered account chip). Next: set `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`/`GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI` in `/etc/default/slice`, restart with `tools/ops/slicectl.sh`, and verify polished login/logout on `dudda.cloud`.
