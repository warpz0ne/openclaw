## Current Objective
Set up durable session continuity so context survives overnight and across restarts.

## Current Focus
Rebuild continuity workflow before resuming feature/project work.

## Next 3 Actions
1. Keep `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` updated after each meaningful work block.
2. Update `MEMORY.md` when decisions/preferences become long-term.
3. End each session with a handoff snapshot (Done / In progress / Next step).

## Open Thread to Resume
Installed Himalaya + GoPlaces CLIs. Next: configure Himalaya account(s) and define sender/type-based email automation rules.

## Session Handoff Template
- Done:
- In progress:
