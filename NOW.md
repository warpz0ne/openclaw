## Current Objective
Set up durable session continuity so context survives overnight and across restarts.

## Current Focus
Rebuild continuity workflow before resuming feature/project work.

## Next 3 Actions
1. Keep `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` updated after each meaningful work block.
2. Update `MEMORY.md` when decisions/preferences become long-term.
3. End each session with a handoff snapshot (Done / In progress / Next step).

## Open Thread to Resume
Slice auth wall implemented in code. Next: configure Google OAuth Web client for dhudha.cloud, set env vars, restart Slice service, verify login/logout end-to-end.
