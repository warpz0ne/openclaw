# Session Notes (2026-02-28 UTC)

- User reported frustration about losing overnight context and requested stronger continuity.
- Agreed to implement a persistent continuity system:
  - `NOW.md` as active working state and next actions.
  - Daily memory checkpoints in `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`.
  - Long-term decisions/preferences promoted to `MEMORY.md`.
  - A consistent handoff template for end-of-session context.
- Open thread: skills installation/status needs a fresh, explicit checkpoint entry when resumed.
- Skills checkpoint completed: verified requested five skills are installed (`summarize`, `weather`, `workflow-orchestrator`, `web-research-verifier`, `healthcheck`); no installation needed.

Checkpoint (2026-02-28 15:03 UTC)
- Done: explained `goplaces`, `himalaya`, and `model-usage`; mapped which are useful for email automation.
- In progress: defining a global breaking-news monitoring approach using existing skills.
- Next step: if user approves, set up a scheduled “News Radar v1” workflow (categories + cadence + alert threshold).
