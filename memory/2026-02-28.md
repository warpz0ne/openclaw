# Session Notes (2026-02-28 UTC)

- User reported frustration about losing overnight context and requested stronger continuity.
- Agreed to implement a persistent continuity system:
  - `NOW.md` as active working state and next actions.
  - Daily memory checkpoints in `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`.
  - Long-term decisions/preferences promoted to `MEMORY.md`.
  - A consistent handoff template for end-of-session context.
- Open thread: skills installation/status needs a fresh, explicit checkpoint entry when resumed.
- Skills checkpoint completed: verified requested five skills are installed (`summarize`, `weather`, `workflow-orchestrator`, `web-research-verifier`, `healthcheck`); no installation needed.
- User requested installing `goplaces`, `himalaya`, and `model-usage` tooling; skill definitions exist, but required CLIs were not present initially.
- Installed at user level (no sudo):
  - `himalaya` v1.2.0 -> `~/.local/bin/himalaya`
  - `goplaces` v0.3.0 -> `~/.local/bin/goplaces`
- `model-usage` deferred for now.
- Installed `gog` v0.11.0 at `~/.local/bin/gog` for Gmail/Google OAuth-native automation.
- Verified install and checked auth state: `gog auth list` returned “No tokens stored” (setup pending).

Checkpoint (2026-02-28 15:03 UTC)
- Done: explained `goplaces`, `himalaya`, and `model-usage`; mapped which are useful for email automation.
- In progress: defining a global breaking-news monitoring approach using existing skills.
- Next step: if user approves, set up a scheduled “News Radar v1” workflow (categories + cadence + alert threshold).

Checkpoint (2026-02-28 16:02 UTC)
- Done: verified Gmail POP/Gmailify deprecation details and clarified impact on IMAP/forwarding; installed `gog` v0.11.0.
- In progress: secure Gmail automation onboarding with OAuth + Secret Manager.
- Next step: user to create OAuth desktop client JSON, store it in Google Secret Manager, then run `gog auth` flow and validate with a Gmail search test.

Checkpoint (2026-02-28 16:34 UTC)
- Done: `gog` Gmail auth tested successfully; mailbox retrieval works.
- Done: implemented Slice web auth gate with Google Sign-In + session cookie + logout flow.
- Done: added new auth page (`/login`) and created `slice-logo.svg` for login branding.
- In progress: configure Google OAuth **Web client** + set `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`/`ALLOWED_EMAILS` in runtime and redeploy.
- Next step: validate login on `dudda.cloud` and enforce secure cookie in production (`SESSION_SECURE=1`).
- User corrected domain spelling: `dudda.cloud` (not `dhudha.cloud`).
